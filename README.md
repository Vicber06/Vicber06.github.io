# Notes about the project or code
* Manny links or files are not done or made (like the Cv) this is because it wasn't necessary for the project, i didn't have time or i was just lazy
* The site may not work with every aspect ratio, it is only optimised for my pc and certen phones (Iohone SE)
* The site is only tested with opera gx and no other browser
